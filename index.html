      <h2 class="paragraph2">Napoli is my favorite sports team.  I love to go to the stadium when I am in Naples.  It is an experience that I wish everyone would try.</h2>

      <h2 class="paragraph2">The Stadio San Paolo, located in the Fuorigrotta area of Naples.  This is the heart that beats with the passion and love that Neapolitans have for their city and colors.</h2>

      <h2 class="paragraph2">The Curva B, made famous by Nino D'Angelo's love song with the city and the club.  The Ultras of Curva B are very outspoken and very visual.  It's a spectacle to behold.  The energy in the stadium during big matches against league rivals, Juventus and Roma can be felt even in the buildings around the park.  Napoli supporters are also famous for causing small "earthquakes" during home Champions League matches.  During the opening Champions League song, it has become customary for the entire stadium to yell "THE CHAMPIONS" at the end of the song.  This yell can be felt by seismic meters located near Vesuvius.  There is about an 8 mile linear distance between the 2 locations. and seismic readings of up to 4 on the richter scale.</h2>

      <h2 class="paragraph2">The city is a beautiful place.  It sits nestled in the Bay of Naples under the shadow of Vesuvius, the volcano that destroyed Pompeii in 79 AD.</h2>

      <h2 class="paragraph2">The Castel Dell'Ovo is the oldest standing fortification in Naples.  It is located on the seaside, right on the Bay of Naples.  It receives many visitors each year.  It is located on Via Partenope, a pedestrian only area with many restaurants and 3 to 5 star hotels with amazing seaside views.</h2>

      <h2 class="paragraph2">Castel Sant'Elmo is at the exact opposite place that the Castel Dell'Ovo is located!  It sits atop the hill near Certosa di San Martino, overlooking La Villa Communale and all of "Lower Naples".  Documents date a structure at the site in 1275.  It was made into a fortress in 1537 by Don Pedro De Toledo.  It was used as a prison from 1860 unitl 1952.  It was used as a military property until 1976 when which a large restoration project was undertaken by provincial authorities.  Today the castle is used as a library, city offices and also a permanent art exhibit.</h2>

      <h2 class="paragraph2">The Castel Nuovo also know as Maschio(ma-skee-oh) Angioino (angie-oh-ee-no), is a castle located in the heart of Naples.  It was built in 1279 and was the seat of power for the kings of Naples, Aragon and Spain until 1815.  It is the first castle that visitors coming in from the cruise ships see as they come in and go out from the Porto di Napoli, Molo Beverello.  It is also my personal favorite castle in Naples.</h2>
